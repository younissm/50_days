## What I learned

- `input:valid` pseudo class selector
  - The `:valid` pseudo-class in CSS is used to style input elements that contain valid data according to the constraints set by their attributes, such as `type`, `pattern`, or `required`. For example, you can change the background color of a valid input field with the rule `input:valid { background-color: green; }`
- `button:active` pseudo class selector
  - Activates on click
- `transition: 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)`
  - The `cubic-bezier` function in CSS is used to create smooth transitions by defining a cubic BÃ©zier curve with four control points. It allows you to customize the timing of animations, where the first and last points are fixed at (0, 0) and (1, 1), while the other two points determine the curve's shape and speed.
- `transition-delay` property
  - Adds a delay to when the transition happens
